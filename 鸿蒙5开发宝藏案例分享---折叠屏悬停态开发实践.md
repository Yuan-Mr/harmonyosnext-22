### 🌟【HarmonyOS Foldable Development Treasure Guide】The Official Docs Hide So Many Gems! Master Hover State Development Step by Step 🌟  

Hey folks! It's your old pal XX. While working on a HarmonyOS foldable project recently, I stumbled upon hidden treasures in the official docs! Turns out HarmonyOS already has tons of practical cases ready. Today, I must show you the right way to unlock "hover state" development—don't miss out!  


### 📱 Let's Start with the Basics: What Is Hover State?  
It's when you fold the device like a laptop, propping it up on a table, and the screen splits into upper and lower halves automatically. HarmonyOS offers three implementation methods—let's explore each!  


### I. Lazy Mode: FolderStack Component  
(Perfect for simple scenarios like video/music players)  
```typescript  
// Code as easy as a sandwich!  
FolderStack({ upperItems: ['video'] }) {  
  VideoComponent().id('video')  // Upper half playback area  
  ControlPanel()               // Lower half control bar  
}  
```  
✨ Practical Tips:  
1. Must set the `upperItems` array to tell the system which components to place upstairs  
2. Hover layout only triggers in full-screen mode (key point!)  
3. Ideal for live streaming apps where comments auto-sink  


### II. Split Screen Wizard: FoldSplitContainer  
(A must-see for dual-screen gaming/office apps)  
```typescript  
FoldSplitContainer({  
  primary: () => <GameScreen/>,  // Upper half game screen  
  secondary: () => <Joystick/>  // Lower half virtual joystick  
})  
```  
🎮 Case Extensions:  
● Food delivery apps: Upper half map + lower half merchant list  
● Stock software: Upper half K-line chart + lower half trading panel  
⚠️ Note: The system enforces 2/3-column layouts—see the next solution for fancy layouts!  


### III. Pro Mode: Custom Hover State  
(For special-angle hover shooting in camera apps)  
```typescript  
// Monitor these two key events!  
display.on('foldStatusChange', (status) => {  
  if (status === 'half-folded' && isLandscape) {  
    const creaseRegion = display.getCurrentFoldCreaseRegion()  
    // Unleash your layout magic...  
  }  
})  
```  
🔥 Advanced Tricks:  
1. Trigger hover only at specific angles (e.g., 60°–120°)  
2. Dynamically adjust the camera viewfinder to avoid creases  
3. Implement Douyin's hover play + floating comment section  


### 🚀 Pitfall Prevention Guide (Hard-Won Experience)  
1. Convert crease region coordinates using `px2vp`  
2. Remember to `off` event listeners when the page is destroyed!  
3. The crease region on Huawei Mate X3 is 5px larger than on Pocket S (实测 data)  
4. Disable bottom nav bar clicks in hover state (official recommended approach)
